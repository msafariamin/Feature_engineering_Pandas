Feature engineering is the engineering on features, but what is a feature? Generally speaking, any attribute could be a feature, as long as it is useful to us, and feature engineering is a process of selecting and transforming variables when creating a predictive model using machine learning or statistical modeling(deep learning, decision trees, or regression). The purpose of feature engineering is for understanding the context and solving the problem by creating, transforming, extracting and selecting the features which could make the predictive model more precise possible .

You have to think about of data cleaning as a process of subtraction and feature engineering as a process of addition.
